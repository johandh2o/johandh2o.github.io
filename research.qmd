### Efficient estimation of effects from modified stochastic interventions,  

Stochastic (soft) interventions provide fine-grained ways to modify treatment assignment via probabilistic or functional shifts. I study query formulation, interpretability, and efficient estimation under such interventions.

I develop two families of cost-aware interventions that generalize _incremental propensity score interventions_ (IPI) for discrete treatments $A\in\mathcal{A}=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_K\}$ with costs $c(\alpha_k)\geq 0$. A scalar $\delta\in\mathbb{R}$ defines interpolations from the organic propensity $\pi$ or a target policy $\nu$ toward a _product-of-experts_ blend:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi^*_\delta(a\,|\, w) &= \frac{(\zeta_\delta+\xi_\delta(a))\,\pi(a\,|\, w)}{\sum_{a'\in\mathcal{A}}(\zeta_\delta+\xi_\delta(a'))\,\pi(a'\,|\, w)},\\ 
    \nu^*_\delta(a\,|\, w) &= \frac{\nu(a)-\xi_\delta(a)(1-\pi(a\,|\, w))}{\sum_{a'\in\mathcal{A}}(\zeta_\delta+\xi_\delta(a'))\,\pi(a'\,|\, w)},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\xi_\delta(a) :=\nu(a)\left(1-e^{-\delta c(a)}\right)$ and $\zeta_\delta :=\sum_{a'\in\mathcal{A}}\nu(a')\,e^{-\delta c(a')}$

We derived the _efficient influence function_, under a nonparametric model, of the expected outcomes under these interventions: $\mathbb{E}[Y^{\pi^*_\delta}]$ and $\mathbb{E}[Y^{\nu^*_\delta}]$, respectively, and implemented respective Newton-Raphson one-step estimators.

**Research questions**:

- How can cost-aware stochastic interventions be embedded in resource-constrained decision problems (budgets, deployment costs), and what optimality/duality conditions follow?
- How can data-dependent targets (e.g., learned dynamic treatment regimes) be incorporated while preserving identification and enabling efficient inference in the presence of nonregularity?

### Graphical models for causal inference under selection and mechanism shift,

I develop graphical models that encode selection, missingness, attrition, and mechanism shifts. 

Conside a point exposure variable $A$, outcome $Y_1$ and confounders $W$ and $Y_0$ (a lagged, pre-exposure outcome). Some units may have $Y_0$ missing ($R_{Y_0}=0$). If the missingness reflects that the **unit itself** lacks access to $Y_0$ (or $Y_0$ was not realized), downstream mechanisms can change because $Y_0$ cannot inform either $A$ or $Y_1$ for them. Standard missing data graphs ($m$-graphs) cannot represent these shifts. We introduce an augmented graphical model --$lm$-graphs-- that explicitly encodes such shifts and supports identification analysis.

![Figure: Graphical representations of systems with missing data on covariate $Y_0$ (a confounder of the casual relationship between $A$ and $Y_1$): (a) An $m$-graph including the proxy variable $Y^\dagger_0$, represented in a blue box as a deterministic function of $R_{Y_0}$ and $Y_0$. (b) An $lm$-graph illustrating labeled CSIs, where $Y_0$ is an input for the mechanisms of $A$ and $Y_1$ when observed ($R_{Y_0} = 1$), but it is not when missing ($R_{Y_0} = 0$). Consequently, $R_{Y_0}$ becomes a causal parent of $A$ and $Y_1$.](lmgraphs.png){width="400"}

In this graph, the _full_ average treatment effect (FATE) can be recovered as:
$$
\Delta_a\mathbb{E}[Y\mid \operatorname{do}(A=a,R_{Y_0}=1)] = \mathbb{E}_W\mathbb{E}_{Y_0|W,R_{Y_0}=1}\Delta_a\mathbb{E}[Y\,|\,W,Y_0,A=a,R_{Y_0}=1],
$$

and the _natural_ average treatment effect (NATE) as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_a\mathbb{E}[Y\mid \operatorname{do}(A=a)] =& \mathbb{P}(R_{Y_0}=0)\,\mathbb{E}_{W|R_{Y_0}=0}[Y\,|\,W,A=a,R_{Y_0}=0]\\
&+ \mathbb{P}(R_{Y_0}=1)\,\mathbb{E}_{W,Y_0|R_{Y_0}=1}[Y\,|\,W,Y_0,A=a,R_{Y_0}=1].
\end{aligned}
$$

**Research questions**:

- How do the fundamental limits of statistical testability in missing-data models shape identification and inference under $lm$-graphs?   
- How the existence of context-specific independences (CSI) impact the construction of regular parametric submodels and the feasibility of efficient estimators (e.g., TMLE)?

### Partial identification of causal and counterfactual queries,

I study how shape constraints can enable point or partial identification for causal and counterfactual parameters.

For instance, with a binary point exposure $A$, an (absolutely) continuous outcome $Y$, and pre-exposure stratification variable $X$, one can define the _probability of tiered benefit_, given cutoffs $c=\{c_k\}_{k=1}^{K-1}$, as:
$$
\operatorname{PB}_c(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K-1}\mathbb{P}(Y^0\in (c_{k-1},c_k],Y^1>c_k\,|\,X=x).
$$

![Figure: The probability of tiered benefit with a continuous outcome is the volume under the joint PDF of potential outcomes $(Y^0,Y^1)|X=x$ enclosed above the benefit region (gray area): (a) $K=3$, (b) $K=4$. ](fancy.png){width="550"}

Under strong monotonicity, i.e. $\mathbb{P}(Y^1-Y^0\geq 0\,|\,X=x)\in\{0,1\}$, this parameter is point identified when $K=2$ provided $P(Y\,|\,X,\operatorname{do}(A=a))$ is identified. For $K\geq 3$, monotonicity is insufficient and additional shape constraints are needed --or a shift to a partial identification strategy.

I investigate how shape constraints can yield informative bounds for such counterfactuals (including instrumental variables settings) and how to estimate them efficiently, noting that extremum-type functionals often lead to nonregular estimators.

**Research questions**:

- When do shape constraints deliver tighter or more interpretable bounds than _optimal transport_ (OT) relaxations and other techniques?
- How can we design TMLE estimators for extremum (nonregular) functionals that remain stable and provide valid inference?

### Econometric analysis of regional and network drivers of development.


I work at the intersection of econometrics, networks, financial economics, and regional development; often translating analyses into interactive tools. Selected projects include:

- Belief and participation cycles in equity markets: analyzed entry–exit dynamics where belief cycles drive participation cycles ([Shinny app](https://financebi.shinyapps.io/buyhigh_crylater/)).
- Asset prices and portfolio choice in OLG models: studied asset-price and portfolio-choice dynamics in overlapping-generations settings; built an interactive visualization ([Shinny app](https://financebi.shinyapps.io/learning_from_experience/)).
- US-Latin America trade flows: measured and visualized bilateral trade exposure and dynamics ([Shinny app](https://johandh2o.shinyapps.io/usalac/)).
- Regional competitiveness in Colombia: constructed and benchmarked competitiveness indices for Colombian departments ([Shinny app](https://johandh2o.shinyapps.io/ECD2019/)).
- Network and peer effects in sustainable agriculture: used game-theoretic models to study regional adoption and contagion processes (Master’s thesis).
