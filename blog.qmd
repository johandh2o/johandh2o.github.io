## When selection depends on mediation: part 1

We review the motivation and assumptions for the *inverse probability weighting* (IPW) estimator of the average treatment effect (ATE) using experimental data (randomized treatment assignment) affected by selection bias. The IPW estimator of the ATE can be expressed in terms of:

$$
\hat{\mathbb{E}}[Y\mid do(A=a)]= N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}[A_i=a] v_i(a)\cdot w_i\cdot y_i 
$$

We check consistency and present a small simulation for the case where the selection mechanism depends on the treatment assignment and other pre-treatment variables.

We open the discussion for the case where the selection mechanism depends on a mediator of the effect as well.
