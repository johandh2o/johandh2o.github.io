Additionally, I hold a research position at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), where I work under the guidance of Dr. Guido Biele.\nMy research focuses on integrating causal inference with machine learning models to develop robust, scalable and reliable algorithms that enable decision-making across complex data environments. My PhD work uncovers pathways for identification, partial identification, recovery, robust estimation and stable inference for causal and counterfactual queries in systems affected by preferential selection mechanisms. I apply these methods to assess the impact of ADHD treatment on school performance using observational data.\nI hold undergraduate degrees in industrial engineering and economics from Universidad de los Andes (UniAndes) in Colombia. Moreover, I earned master’s degrees in economics and statistics, the latter from Michigan State University (MSU), where I was an international Fulbright scholar.\nI have professional experience as a research consultant and lead data scientist, where I contributed to projects in areas such as impact evaluation, regional competitiveness, international trade, mobile banking, and alternative credit scoring."
