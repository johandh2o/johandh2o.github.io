## About me

I am currently pursuing my PhD in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences ([MatNat](https://www.mn.uio.no/english/)) at the University of Oslo ([UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/)), under the supervision of [Dr. Johan Pensar](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/johanpen/). Additionally, I hold a research position at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ([NIPH](https://www.fhi.no/en/)), supervised by [Dr. Guido Biele](https://gbiele.github.io/).

I hold undergraduate degrees in industrial engineering and economics from Universidad de los Andes ([UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en)) in Colombia. Additionally, I have master's degrees in economics and statistics. I earned the latter at Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/)) as an international [Fulbright](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) scholar.

I have prior experience working as a research consultant and lead data scientist, contributing to projects involving impact evaluation, regional competitiveness, international trade, mobile banking, and alternative credit scoring.
