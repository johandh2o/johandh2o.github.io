## About me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Integreat](https://www.integreat.no) -- the Norwegian Centre for Knowledge-driven Machine Learning at University of Oslo ([UiO](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/johanmd/)). I am an international [Fulbright](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) scholar.

## Research and academic profile

My research develops methodology at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. It spans several topics, including:

- Causal inference under network interference,
- Modified stochastic interventions,
- Selection mechanisms and mechanism shifts,
- Graphical representations of causal models,
- Partial identification of counterfactual queries.

I recently completed a PhD (Statistics) at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/), UiO. My academic background also includes:

- MSc. Statistics -- Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/)),
- MA. Economics -- Universidad de los Andes ([UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en)), 
- BA. Economics -- UniAndes,
- BEng. Industrial Engineering -- UniAndes. 

## Professional experience

I have worked as a researcher, consultant, and lead data scientist on projects involving:

- Evaluating the benefits of pharmacological treatment for children with ADHD,
- Analyzing international trade and investment flows,
- Designing and assessing randomized experiments for mobile banking products, and
- Quantitatively benchmarking regional competitiveness.
