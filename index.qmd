## About me

I am an international [Fulbright](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) scholar and currently work as a researcher. My research primarily focuses on **causal inference with observational data**, **graphical models for information selection**, **semiparametric estimation theory**, and **spatial econometrics**. 

I recently completed my **PhD in Statistics at the Department of Mathematics**, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences ([MatNat](https://www.mn.uio.no/english/)), at the University of Oslo ([UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/)). My academic background also includes:

- MSc in Statistics -- Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/))
- MA in Economics -- Universidad de los Andes ([UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en)) 
- BA in Economics -- UniAndes
- BEng in Industrial Engineering -- UniAndes. 

My professional experience spans roles as a **researcher**, **consultant**, and **lead data scientist**. I have contributed to projects involving: 

- the evaluation of benefits from pharmacological treatment for ADHD,
- the analysis of international trade and investment flows, 
- the design and evaluation of randomized experiments for mobile banking products, and
- the quantitative assessment of regional competitiveness, among others.
