## About me

I'm completing my PhD degree at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences ([MatNat](https://www.mn.uio.no/english/)) at the University of Oslo ([UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/)), under the supervision of [Dr. Johan Pensar](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/johanpen/). Additionally, I hold a research position at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ([NIPH](https://www.fhi.no/en/)), where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Guido Biele](https://gbiele.github.io/). 

My research focuses on integrating causal inference with machine learning models to develop robust, scalable and reliable algorithms that enable decision-making across complex data environments. My PhD work uncovers pathways for identification, partial identification, recovery, robust estimation and stable inference for causal and counterfactual queries in systems affected by preferential selection mechanisms. I apply these methods to assess the impact of ADHD treatment on school performance using observational data.

I hold undergraduate degrees in industrial engineering and economics from Universidad de los Andes ([UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en)) in Colombia. Moreover, I earned masterâ€™s degrees in economics and statistics, the latter from Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/)), where I was an international [Fulbright](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) scholar.

I have professional experience as a research consultant and lead data scientist, where I contributed to projects in areas such as impact evaluation, regional competitiveness, international trade, mobile banking, and alternative credit scoring.

## Research

My research interests and experience include:

- Leveraging graphical criteria to recover causal queries in settings with selection mechanisms

- Constructing partial identification strategies for counterfactual benefit parameters with ordered tiered outcomes

- Developing multiply-robust and efficient estimation procedures grounded in semiparametric theory

- Integrating insights from econometrics, game theory, statistics, and network science to offer new perspectives for motivated applications
