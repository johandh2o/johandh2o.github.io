## About me

I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences ([MatNat](https://www.mn.uio.no/english/)) at the University of Oslo ([UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/)), under the supervision of [Dr. Johan Pensar](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/johanpen/). Concurrently, I am a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ([NIPH](https://www.fhi.no/en/)), under the supervision of [Dr. Guido Biele](https://gbiele.github.io/).

I hold baccalaureate degrees in industrial engineering and in economics, from Universidad de los Andes ([UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en)) in Colombia; plus master's degrees in economics and in statistics, the latter from Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/)). I am an international [Fulbright scholar](https://foreign.fulbrightonline.org/) (2019).

## Research

My research interests, accumulated knowledge and experience gravitate around:

-   Causal inference with observational data

-   Epistemic uncertainty quantification for machine learning and causal inference

-   Statistics + game theory: strategic complements networks, and dynamic treatment regimes
